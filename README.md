OpenFish is a local-first remote coding assistant for one trusted owner.
It lets you control local repositories from Telegram while execution, state, approvals, and audit logs remain on your machine.

## Architecture

![OpenFish Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE_EN.png)

Detailed architecture notes: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Product Scope

OpenFish is built for:

- single-user operation
- project-scoped continuity
- conservative execution boundaries
- concise mobile-friendly Telegram interaction

OpenFish is not:

- a multi-user bot platform
- a public remote shell
- a cloud orchestration system

## Core Capabilities

- Project lifecycle: list, select, add, disable, archive
- Task lifecycle: ask, do, resume, retry, cancel
- Scheduling: add/list/run/pause/enable/delete periodic tasks
- Approval flow: approve/reject continuation
- Project memory: notes, recent summaries, status snapshots
- Safe file analysis: upload with extension/size/path checks

## Telegram UX

- High-frequency home keyboard for `Projects`, `Ask`, `Do`, `Status`, `Resume`, `Diff`, `Schedule`, `More`, `Help`
- Button-first approval flow, including note/reason wizards tied to explicit `approval_id`
- Persisted step-by-step wizards for project add, schedule add, template run, and approval note/reason
- Chat-scoped UI mode with concise mobile summaries
- Status/projects/schedule/approval/more panels now prefer updating the latest card instead of spamming new messages
- Short-window outbound dedup plus recent message reference tracking for stable Telegram rendering

## Quick Start

Install the package entrypoint first:

```bash
pip install -e ./mvp_scaffold
```

Then run OpenFish through the `openfish` CLI:

```bash
openfish install
openfish configure
openfish check
openfish start
```

The primary lifecycle commands are now native CLI commands:

- `openfish install`
- `openfish configure`
- `openfish init-home`
- `openfish check`
- `openfish start`
- `openfish stop`
- `openfish restart`
- `openfish status`
- `openfish logs`

Update behavior is mode-aware:

- repository mode: `openfish update` performs git-based self-update
- package/home mode: use `python -m pip install --upgrade openfish`

If you want a user-home runtime instead of repository-local runtime data, bootstrap it first:

```bash
openfish init-home
export OPENFISH_HOME=~/.config/openfish
openfish check
openfish start
```

If you do not know your Telegram user ID yet, send `/start` to the bot first, then run:

```bash
openfish tg-user-id
```

Legacy script entrypoint remains available for compatibility:

```bash
bash mvp_scaffold/scripts/install_start.sh start
```

## Docker

OpenFish also includes a Docker runtime skeleton for long-running self-hosted deployment.

```bash
openfish docker-up
```

Current Docker assumptions:

- `.env` stays at repository root
- `mvp_scaffold/projects.yaml` is mounted into the container
- `~/.codex` is mounted into the container
- your workspace root is mounted to `/workspace`

Docker is optional. For local owner-operated usage, the `openfish` CLI remains the primary path.

Supported Docker helper commands:

- `openfish docker-up`
- `openfish docker-down`
- `openfish docker-logs`
- `openfish docker-ps`

## Command Overview

Core commands:

- `/projects`, `/use <project>`, `/status`
- `/ask <question>`, `/do <task>`, `/resume [task_id] [instruction]`
- `/approve [note]`, `/reject [reason]`, `/cancel`
- `/diff`, `/memory`, `/note <text>`, `/help`

Extended commands:

- `/project-root [abs_path]`
- `/project-add`, `/project-disable`, `/project-archive`
- `/skills`, `/skill-install`
- `/schedule-add`, `/schedule-list`, `/schedule-run`, `/schedule-pause`, `/schedule-enable`, `/schedule-del`
- `/start`, `/last`, `/retry`, `/upload_policy`

Telegram quick buttons cover all command capabilities:

- no-arg commands execute directly
- high-friction commands enter persisted step-by-step wizards

## Documentation

User-facing docs:

- Chinese homepage: [README_CN.md](README_CN.md)
- Architecture details: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Persistence details: [docs/PERSISTENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/PERSISTENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Install/Deploy/Usage manual (Chinese): [docs/安装部署和使用手册.md](docs/安装部署和使用手册.md)

## Repository Layout

- Runtime app: `mvp_scaffold/`
- Docs: `docs/`
- Config samples: `env.example`, `projects.example.yaml`
- DB schema: `schema.sql`

## Security Notes

- Rotate bot token immediately if it appears in logs/screenshots.
- Do not commit `.env`, runtime data, or local secret-bearing config.
- Keep allowed project directories minimal and explicit.
